        title: "How do solar panels work?",
        description: `
         Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity
         using photovoltaic (PV) cells. When sunlight hits the cells,
         it creates an electric field that generates direct current (DC)
         electricity. This DC electricity is then converted to
         alternating current (AC) electricity using an inverter, making
         it usable for your home or business.

         Installing solar panels can reduce or eliminate your
         electricity bills, increase the value of your property,
         decrease your carbon footprint, and provide a renewable
         source of energy. Additionally, many regions offer incentives
         and rebates for solar installations.
